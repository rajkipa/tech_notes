Golden Principle of security
1. Know your system
2. Principle of least privilege ===> SELinux
3. Defence in depth
4. Protection is key but detection is must
5. Know your enemy

DAC = Discretionary Access Control (rwx, chmod, setfacl)
MAC = Mandatory Access Control (SELinux, RBAC)

SELinux = Security Enhanced Linux
	It is a Mandatory Access Control
	It is implemented through kernel modules called security modules and user space tools
	Redhat Implement the targeted policy of selinux which restricts are targeted process 
	example of targeted policies are TCP/UDP, files/directories, memory locations and others

SELinux has 4 forms of access control:
1. Targeted Enforcement (TE) 
2. Strict
3. Role based Access Control (RBAC)
4. Multi-level security (MLS)

Modes in SELinux
1. Enabled = SELinux policy is checked and active
2. Permissive = SELinux policy is checked and not enforcing. 
3. Disabled = SELinux doesn't play any role

SELinux can be defined in one word as labeling

Subjects = Process
Objects  = File, TCP/UDP, sockets, FIFO
Every subjects and objects have one security context attached to it.
If it is associated to process it's called domain
If it's associated to file is called file context


example of selinux context
user:role:type:level

context hell
1. If you move a file, the context of original file maintains
2. If you copy a file where it exists in destination it maintains the context of destination file and if it doesn't exist it gets the context based on the directory above it.


Core Programs to manipulate selinux is
chcon, setfiles, restorecon, sestatus


To relabel the files for a system with disabled mode
touch /.autorelabel
reboot


to do audit search
ausearch -i -m AVC,USER_AVC -sv no


To fix selinux
1. wrong subject context
2. wrong object context
3. right subject and object context but no access
4. Intrusion



It is a type enforcing system.
log file: /var/log/messages and /var/log/audit/audit.log
the cache of selinux messages are called as Access Vector Cache (AVC)
